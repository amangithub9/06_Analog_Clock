Hour Rotation:

* The hour completes a full rotation (360 degrees) in 12 hours.
* So, the rotation per hour is 360 / 12 = 30 degrees.
* Additionally, the hour hand should move based on the minute progress within the hour. * So, for every minute, it should move 30 / 60 = 0.5 degrees.
* The total rotation for the hour hand is then (hours % 12 + minutes / 60) * 30 degrees.

Minute Rotation:

* The minute completes a full rotation in 60 minutes (1 hour).
* Therefore, the rotation per minute is 360 / 60 = 6 degrees.
* The total rotation for the minute hand is (minutes + seconds / 60) * 6 degrees.

Second Rotation:

* The second completes a full rotation in 60 seconds (1 minute).
* Hence, the rotation per second is 360 / 60 = 6 degrees.
* The total rotation for the second hand is seconds * 6 degrees.
